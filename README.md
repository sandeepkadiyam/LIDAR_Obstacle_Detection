# LIDAR_Obstacle_Detection
LIDAR Sensor is one of the crucial sensors in the state of art autonomous vehicles. A high resolution point cloud data of the scene surrounding the vehicle can be obtained using LIDAR. In this project, various techniques have been performed on the point cloud data to determine the obstacles in the scene.
